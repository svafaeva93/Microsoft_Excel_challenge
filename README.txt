Excel Challenge 

This Excel project highlights my proficiency in Excel applying advanced techniques, such as conditional formatting, pivot tables and lookup functions. 

Requirements: 
- Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the Percent Funded column according to a three-color scale. The scale starts at 0 with a dark shade of red, and it should transition to green at 100 and blue at 200.
- Create a new column called Average Donation that uses a formula to find how much each project backer paid on average.
- Create two new columns, one called Parent Category and another called Sub-Category, that use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into the two new, separate columns.
- Create a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.
- Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country.
- The dates in the deadline and launched_at columns use Unix timestamps, an Excel formula is used to convert these timestamps to a normal date.
- Using the COUNTIFS() formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within a given range. Populate the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns with these data points.
- Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal amount and its chances of success, failure, or cancellation.
- Use Excel to evaluate the following values for successful campaigns:

Evaluate: 
- The mean number of backers
- The median number of backers
- The minimum number of backers
- The maximum number of backers
- The variance of the number of backers
- The standard deviation of the number of backers
